# 👋 Hey, I'm Momo!

🧠 14 y/o developer with a passion for **Linux**, **programming languages**, and building **cool tools**. I love experimenting with **Linux-based projects** and bringing creativity to the command line.

## 🚀 About Me

I’ve been coding for **5+ years**, and I’m all about creating efficient, minimal tools that make your workflow smoother. I specialize in **shell scripting** and love working on **Linux-related projects**. Here’s a breakdown of what I’ve been working on:

- 🐍 **Python** — 5+ years
- 🐚 **Bash/Zsh/sh** — 3 years (currently using **Zsh** with **OhMyZsh**)
- 🌐 **HTML & CSS** — 2 years
- 🔨 **Go & Java** — learning (basic Java knowledge, Go in progress)

I enjoy working in **terminal environments** and focus a lot on making the user experience efficient and fun.

## 🧪 Featured Projects

### 🐝 [Honeycomb](https://github.com/MOHAPY24/Honeycomb)
An **esoteric programming language** I built. It’s strange, experimental, and definitely not for the faint of heart. Perfect for anyone who loves to think outside the box.

### 🕋 [Tabsh](https://github.com/MOHAPY24/tabsh)
A **custom Arabic shell** made to bring a native, localized experience to the terminal. Built entirely with **Bash** and a love for diverse languages.
